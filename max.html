        The greatest adventure of all time is a term used by many people to
        describe the life of Jesus. The term was first used in the 19th century
        by a group of German missionaries to the Congo, who believed that the
        life of Jesus was the greatest adventure of all time. The term has been
        used in different ways throughout history, but has been used mostly to
        mean that the life of Jesus is the greatest adventure ever.

      <p>Polar Bear - 11/10</p>
      <p>
        Finding a good software developer for hire in this day and age is really
        hard. I've been so lucky to find Max. He tells me so repeatedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Max really is the best software developer available out there. At least
        he says so himself, and who am I to question him? After all, polar bears
        knows nothing about code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Max has made an astounding personal website for me. At least he said so.
        Internet access is scarce in the north pole so I've not seen it with my
        own eyes.
