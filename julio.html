        I know a lot of people who are like me. They have a love for fitness,
        but don’t really know where to start. I have been there, and I know how
        it feels to be overwhelmed with all the information out there and not
        know where to begin. There are so many different programs out there, and
        many of them have different levels, meaning that you can’t just jump in
        and start.

        Julio is an excellent software developer. He writes good code, but most
        importantly he feeds me delicious berries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let it be known; A mans love for software is great! But not as great as
        mans love for Julio, whose code is like sweet poetry under the summer
        sun.

        I first became familiar with his work when he asked me to lie for him
        and write a favorable testimonial. He is not going to publish this for
        real, is he? I don't care. I just want the green grass and vegetables he
        promised me.
